 [TODO]

 Eventually when we got it set up mechanically implement brake pedal reading
 
 Add check to only allow calibration while break engaged

 Fix 3v causing the acceleration petal getting stuck at 1-5% when not touched

 Clean up more noise for accurate readings
 
 Improve Readibility: Add more comments, better variable names
